# VLV-Relaxation
A website for a Relaxation Villa

This is a website that I developed as a project in one of the courses I took on Udemy.
The website layout is primarily done using CSS GRID.
Animations and the use of svg's are other things I did during the development of this website.
The website has a "Gallery Carousel" which is made using "Vanilla Javascript"
Undertaking this project, I was able to improve on my CSS skills and basic JAVASRIPT skills.
